# Basic caffe project structure

## Description

https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/rcnn-release
https://github.com/spfjr/caffe-docker-template-project
https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/python-caffe-custom-cifar-10-conv-net

Repository was created to ease the procedure of `caffe` installation.  Since I wasn't able to install `caffe` for 2 days on freshly installed ubuntu 16.04, I decided to create middleware docker with caffe installed, where I would be able to develop `caffe` and create models, and install `caffe` itself without problems.

Dockerfiles are based on `Dockerfile`s available at https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/docker/gpu/Dockerfile. 

## Prerequisites
### General

- docker (https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce-1)
- be sure that port 8888 is not already occupied by any service, otherwise change port in the `Dockerfile`s `start.sh`
### CPU
- working CPU :)

### GPU
- nvidia-docker available at https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker (see **Quickstart** section)
- note: in case of problems with driver installation, the best working solution for me was  https://www.pcsuggest.com/install-nvidia-drivers-ubuntu/#1_Add_the_Ubuntu_graphics-drivers_PPA :
    - don't forget to install `nvidia-prime` with `apt-get`
    - check what is the newest available driver version for you graphics card at http://www.nvidia.pl/Download/index.aspx
- working GPU :) 

## Installation

### CPU
```
git submodule update --init --recursive # ommit if you already have caffe repository here
docker build -t caffe:cpu -f Dockerfile.cpu . 
chmod +x start-cpu.sh
./start-cpu.sh <container-name>
```

### GPU
```
git submodule update --init --recursive # ommit if you already have caffe repository here
nvidia-docker build -t caffe:gpu -f Dockerfile.gpu . 
chmod +x start-gpu.sh
./start-gpu.sh <container-name>
```

## Usage

### Custom projects
1. Install project using above commands
2. `rm -r .git`
3. Create own remote repository on `github` or `gitlab` etc. 
4. Follow instructions for attaching existing directory to remote repository at https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/
5. Modify `.gitsubmodules` if needed to match your project development

### Running scripts
1. Run script using PyCharm with connected remote interpreter
2. Enter container using
    ```
    docker exec -it <container-name> bash
    ```
    and run `python` command on a particular script.

### Caffe development

In case of `caffe` development you can add as a submodule your own modified `caffe` repository or download using first command in the `Installation` section.

### Jupyter
You can access jupyter after run at
```
http://localhost:8888
```
**Password**: `caffe`

### PyCharm development
Feel free to create `PyCharm` project in this repo and connect using remote interpreter. Instructions are available at: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html

### Modifying
In case of adding new packages you can either:

1. Modify `requirements.txt`, add new line with package name, rebuild -> rerun
2. Or access docker with
    ```
    docker exec -it <container-name> bash
    ```
    and install package with `pip install <package-name>`
